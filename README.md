This is a simple yet elegant portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and a pinch of JavaScript to bring dynamic content to life.

## Inspiration
The design and concept were inspired by the work of [unknownsrc](https://github.com/unknownsrc).

I discovered unknownsrc through an YouTube video, which exposed unknownsrc ðŸ¤”. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktxbXlF6UQE).
